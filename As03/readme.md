## Multinomial Naive Bayes ##
Multinomial Naive Bayes is one of the most popular supervised learning classifications that is used for the analysis of the categorical text data. Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text such as a piece of email or newspaper article. It calculates the probability of each tag for a given sample and then gives the tag with the highest probability as output.
